Welcome to the repository dedicated to exploring the fascinating intersection of Language Models (LLMs) and Blockchain technology, known as LangChain. 

#Project Chatbot using LangChain 

Chatbot tailored for a company that builds beverage machinery, employing advanced entity memory techniques. In this project, we delve into the realm of entity memory, a revolutionary memory strategy that empowers our chatbot to not just comprehend but also retain essential facts about specific entities mentioned during conversations.

Unlike traditional memory strategies, entity memory is designed to recognize and remember crucial details such as people's names, product identifiers, and other pertinent information. Leveraging state-of-the-art language models, our chatbot utilizes entity memory to extract key facts and gradually build up its knowledge base over time.

Join us as we explore the capabilities of entity memory in enhancing the functionality and efficiency of chatbots, particularly in industries where accurate information retrieval is paramount, like a machinery business. Let's embark on a journey into the future of conversational AI, where understanding and retaining entity-specific details are at the forefront of interaction.
